    "text": "Today more and more people are using social media, compared to just ten years ago social media usage has consistently grown, a trend that has increased particularly drastically during the Wuhan Corona Virus Lockdowns. However during this same time, there is considerable evidence showing that various measures of mental health such as anxiety, self-esteem, and depression have worsened. The notable similarity between two trends provides ample background for the questioning of a potential connection or correlation between the use of social media, and the prevalence of poor mental health.\nMy background as a stats and probability major inspired me to analyze this through a statistics lens, and so for Math437, I chose to analyze the dataset “Social Media and Mental Health”, which includes variables like time spent on social media, platform preferences, and demographic factors, alongside 12 measures of mental health (Validation sought from social media, and restlessness from lack of use) for my final project. By combining the trends found in this dataset, with context from other similar studies, I hope to better understand, and to expose the connections between social media, and mental health."

    "text": "Main Objective\nThe primary goal is to analyze specific social media usage patterns, such as time spent online or preferred platforms, and determine the correlation with mental health, through predictors such as low self esteem, time spent doom scrolling(browsing social media without a specific purpose), and distractibility scores self reported in the “Social Media and Mental Health” dataset. Using statistical methods in R, I will analyze the data and see how social media usage may influence mental health, and whether specific factors such as time spent per day, type of social media use, or age have compounding effects."

    "section": "Data Description",
    "text": "Data Description\nI am using the ‘Social Media and Mental Health’ dataset, compiled by Souvik Ahmed and sourced from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/souvikahmed071/social-media-and-mental-health?select=smmh.csv),. The dataset was acquired through an online survey, likely administered via Google Forms, and distributed via fliers at the University of Liberal Arts Bangladesh (ULAB) in Dhaka.\nComprising 481 observations and 21 columns, the dataset includes seven predictor variables—age, gender, occupation, organizational affiliation, frequency of social media use, types of social media platforms used, and average daily time spent—and twelve response variables: frequency of aimless social media use (“doom scrolling”), restlessness when not using social media, ease of distraction, level of worry, difficulty concentrating, frequency of comparing oneself to successful people, feelings about these comparisons, frequency of seeking validation from social media, depression levels, fluctuations in interest in daily activities, sleep issues, and self-esteem.\n\nsmmh_data &lt;- read_csv(\"smmh.csv\")\n\n\nData Limitations\nThe survey’s distribution lacks detailed documentation on collection methods or selection, potentially allowing potential selection bias. Furthermore this distribution may over-represent ULAB students, people who already use the internet more, or college students, limiting the sample’s representativeness for broader populations. Self-reported data, including predictor variables and response variables , are susceptible to recall bias and social desirability bias, where respondents may under- or over-report behaviors or symptoms. Notably, the dataset, likely collected 2022 in Bangladesh, reflects a snapshot of one time and place and so factors such as social media access, mental health stigma, or heightened usage may reduce its applicability to other regions or time periods. Additionally, non-standard variables like frequency of aimless social media use and ease of distraction rely on subjective survey questions, which may not align with professional mental health measures. These variables may require interpretation, introducing potential human error or bias. The absence of information on survey oversight, complicates the assessment of data quality and generalizability, meaning the findings in the study should be taken with a grain of salt."

    "text": "Insights\nPlatform Usage Patterns: The EDA showed that Facebook was the most commonly used platform, with approximately 8 in ten people using it , followed by Discord with 4 in ten and Reddit with 3 in ten. This suggests a preference for Facebook, potentially due to its widespread availability and social networking features, while Discord’s lower usage may reflect its niche appeal among younger or tech-savvy respondents. Time Spent on Social Media: The distribution of time spent on social media indicated that most respondents spent More than 5 hours per day, but a median of 2 to three hours, the portion exceeding 5 hours daily around 25 percent. This heavy usage indicates there is enough saturation to determine if there is a correlation. Mental Health Correlations: Scatter plots and correlation analysis revealed a weak positive correlation between negative mental health outcomes between time spent on social media and mental health outcomes. For instance, time spent was moderately correlated with depression suggesting that increased usage may exacerbate these symptoms. Model Performance: The modeling phase evaluated Linear Regression, KNN, and Regression Trees for predicting five mental health outcomes (depression, worry, concentration difficulty, restlessness, comparison frequency) using predictors like time_spent, platform_facebook, platform_reddit, platform_discord, age, gender, occupation, and affiliation. Linear Regression: Achieved an RMSE of 1.374, indicating medium to weak] predictive power. This model performed best for restlessness,but was similar throughout. KNN: Recorded an RMSE of 1.49, performing better for restlessness due to a particularly strong relation in restlessness Regression Trees: Yielded an RMSE of 1.46, with weak and roughly equal rmse throughout. Overall, our model showed the lowest RMSE for Linear regression, suggesting it best captures the relationship between social media usage and mental health for this dataset. These findings suggest that time spent on social media is a stronger predictor of mental health outcomes than platform type, with potentially amplifying effects like comparison frequency. The models supported some of these relationships, though accuracy is fairly weak due in part to human perception and variability of such.\n\nLimitations and Future Work\nThis dataset was both a snapshot, regionally located, and had a relatively small size combined with a fairly small scope and self reported metrics. These make it harder to track the the change over time, whether the trends seen in the scope exists beyond it and whether this is a trend that persisted over time. For future work I would recommend collecting more data and expirements of large samples of people who dont vs do use social media, though this may be difficult to do considering its near ubiquity in everyday life.\n\n\nReflection (Optional Subsection)"
